# Internet Usage API

In this exercise, you will build an API to provide access to UN international internet usage rate data. Think of it as a microservice that provides this data as part of an ecosystem of production components. We suggest you use Ruby on Rails, as we're a Ruby shop and Rails makes it easy to connect to a data store and respond to HTTP requests, but feel free to use any programming language and framework you are comfortable with.

Be sure to use the same best practices that you would use on any production service!

1. Download the UN International Internet Usage Rate data from the email sent by your interviewer
2. Provide a method of loading the file into the data store of your choice.
3. Write an API endpoint that retrieves all data, and also can filter for a single country and/or year.
4. Write some tests that verify that your API is behaving correctly.
5. Add the ability to create, update, and delete data points.
